Some spammers called Essential Business Funding register more domains every day - this is their block list

For whatever reason, some company called Essential Business Funding or Essential Business Financing scraped our email addresses here
and keeps sending about ten emails a day. They also register about two or three new domain names every day.

This simple Git repository exists so you don't need to get their emails.

To use it, use the attached script in your cron job to run daily. Edit your Postfix main file to do header checks.

We update this every day as these scammers register more domains and send more emails.
